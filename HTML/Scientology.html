		<h1 style = "color:white;">Scientology is a set of beliefs and practices invented by American author L. Ron Hubbard, and an associated movement. It has been variously defined as a cult, a business or a new religious movement. Hubbard initially developed a set of ideas which he represented as a form of therapy, called Diane tics. This he promoted through various publications, and through the Hubbard Diane tic Research Foundation, which he established in 1950. The foundation soon entered bankruptcy, and Hubbard lost the rights to his book Diane tics: The Modern Science of Mental Health in 1952. He then recharacterized the subject as a religion and renamed it Scientology, retaining the terminology, doctrines, and the practice of "auditing". Within a year, he regained the rights to Diane tics and retained both subjects under the umbrella of the Church of Scientology.

Scientology followers believe that a human is an immortal, spiritual being (the tan) that is resident in a physical body. The  tan has had innumerable past lives and it is observed in advanced Scientology texts that lives preceding the  tan's arrival on Earth were lived in extraterrestrial cultures. Scientology doctrine states that any Scientologist undergoing auditing will eventually come across and recount a common series of events. Hubbard describes the etymology of the word "Scientology" as coming from the Latin word Scio, meaning know or distinguish, and the Greek word logos, meaning "the word or outward form by which the inward thought is expressed and made known". Hubbard writes, "thus, Scientology means knowing about knowing, or the science of knowledge".
