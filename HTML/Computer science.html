      Computer science is the study of algorithmic processes and computational
      machines. As a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from
      theoretical studies of algorithms, computation and information to the
      practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware and
      software. Computer science addresses any computational problems,
      especially information processes, such as control, communication,
      perception, learning, and intelligence.
